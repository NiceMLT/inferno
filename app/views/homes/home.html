  <p> We ask that new players attend and bring a parent/guardian along to ask any questions they might have.
    Returning players are encouraged to bring a parent/guardian but as much is the same year to year we understand it may not be necessary.
  </p>

  <strong>Players paying dues prior to 11/16 will have their spring jersey ordered early!</strong>

  <p> Additionally, we ask that all parents/player fill out the form below so that we have appropriate contact information for players. </p>
