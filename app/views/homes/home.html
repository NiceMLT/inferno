  <strong> COVID-19 Update </strong>

  <p>For the 2020-2021 School Year, Brookwood Ultimate will follow guidance/guidelines provided
    by our 3 main governing bodies: GCPS, USAU, and GHSA.  What this means for us as a club is that
    we intend to resume our normal Winter/Spring practice and game/tournament season as long as
    Gwinnett County Schools, Georgia High School Athletics, and USA Ultimate have determined that it
    is safe to do so.  There may be additional guidelines/rules in place (such as, but not limited to)
    only playing zone defense, no shared equipment (coach would sanitize and bring discs), no shared
    sidelines, social distancing as much as possible during drills/practice/events. Our hope is to
    play Ultimate but our goal is to stay safe.  Please contact us if you have any questions.
  </p>
