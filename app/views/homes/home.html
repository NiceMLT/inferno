  <h1> Spring Ultimate </h1>

  <h5> 2021 Spring Season Information </h5>

  <p>
    Our spring season is now underway. Practices are being held Tuesday/Thursday 4:30-6:30 at Crews Middle School.
    We are adhering to social distancing guidelines on the field and wearing masks wherever/whenever possible,
    including in the course of play.  We are participating in games vs other local schools currently who are
    adhering to similar guidelines and will continue to do so through the end of the school year.
  </p>

  <p>Interested players should attend practice and fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/1ecEaRmNbcrVeXeXA">Player Form</a></p>


  <strong> COVID-19 Update </strong>

  <p>For the 2020-2021 School Year, Brookwood Ultimate will follow guidance/guidelines provided
    by our 3 main governing bodies: GCPS, USAU, and GHSA.  What this means for us as a club is that
    we intend to resume our normal Winter/Spring practice and game/tournament season as long as
    Gwinnett County Schools, Georgia High School Athletics, and USA Ultimate have determined that it
    is safe to do so.  There may be additional guidelines/rules in place (such as, but not limited to)
    only playing zone defense, no shared equipment (coach would sanitize and bring discs), no shared
    sidelines, social distancing as much as possible during drills/practice/events. Our hope is to
    play Ultimate but our goal is to stay safe.  Please contact us if you have any questions.
